# Statistical Analysis in Python: EDA, Visualization, and Inference

## Introduction

This comprehensive 3-4 hour session provides hands-on training in statistical analysis using Python, focusing on three critical components of data science: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Visualization**, and **Statistical Inference**. Through practical application with real-world demographic data from Rwanda, participants will master the essential tools and techniques needed to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

The session emphasizes a practical, code-first approach where participants will work with authentic population data to understand demographic patterns, administrative divisions, and socioeconomic indicators. By the end of this session, you will have developed a robust workflow for analyzing any dataset, from initial exploration through publication-ready visualizations to statistical hypothesis testing.

We'll be working with Python's most powerful data analysis libraries including **pandas** for data manipulation, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization, **plotly** for interactive graphics, **scipy** for statistical testing, and **statsmodels** for regression analysis. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive analytical narrative that mirrors real-world data science projects.

## Learning Outcomes

By the completion of this session, participants will be able to:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load, inspect, and clean datasets using pandas
- Create derived variables and demographic indicators
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Detect and handle outliers using statistical and visual methods
- Aggregate data across grouping variables

### Data Visualization
- Master matplotlib and seaborn for statistical plots
- Create multi-panel and faceted visualizations
- Apply visualization best practices and professional styling
- Build interactive visualizations using plotly

- Perform t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA
- Build and interpret multiple linear regression models
- Calculate confidence intervals and assess effect sizes
- Check statistical assumptions and handle violations

### Integrated Skills
- Develop end-to-end analytical workflows
- Create reproducible, well-documented analysis
- Communicate findings through data storytelling

## Dataset Description

### Rwanda Administrative Cell Population Data (2020)

This dataset contains comprehensive demographic information for 2,169 administrative cells across Rwanda, representing the most granular level of administrative division in the country. The data captures population demographics, age structure, gender distribution, and basic infrastructure indicators as of 2020, providing rich insights into Rwanda's demographic landscape and spatial population patterns.

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Observations:** 2,169 administrative cells
- **Variables:** 12 core variables plus derived indicators
- **Geographic Coverage:** All provinces, districts, sectors, and cells in Rwanda
- **Time Period:** 2020 population estimates
- **Administrative Levels:** 4-tier hierarchy (Province → District → Sector → Cell)

### Variable Descriptions

#### Geographic Identifiers
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `cell_id` | String | Unique identifier for each administrative cell |
| `province_name` | String | Province name (5 provinces: Kigali, Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern) |
| `district_name` | String | District name within province (30 districts total) |
| `sector_name` | String | Sector name within district (administrative subdivision) |
| `cell_name` | String | Cell name (smallest administrative unit) |

#### Demographic Variables (2020 Population Estimates)
| Variable | Type | Description | Statistical Summary |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `general_2020` | Float | Total population in the cell | Primary population measure |
| `elderly_60_plus_2020` | Float | Population aged 60 years and above | Aging indicator |
| `children_under_five_2020` | Float | Population under 5 years of age | Early childhood demographic |
| `youth_15_24_2020` | Float | Population aged 15-24 years | Youth demographic for education/employment analysis |
| `men_2020` | Float | Male population | Gender analysis component |
| `women_2020` | Float | Female population | Gender analysis component |

#### Infrastructure Indicator
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `building_count` | Float | Number of buildings/structures in the cell |

### Derived Variables Created During Analysis

The following variables are calculated during the EDA process to facilitate deeper demographic analysis:

| Variable | Formula | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `total_population` | `general_2020` | Alias for clarity in analysis |
| `elderly_proportion` | `elderly_60_plus_2020 / total_population` | Share of elderly population (aging index) |
| `children_proportion` | `children_under_five_2020 / total_population` | Share of young children (fertility/development indicator) |
| `youth_proportion` | `youth_15_24_2020 / total_population` | Share of youth population (demographic dividend potential) |
| `gender_ratio` | `(men_2020 / women_2020) × 100` | Number of men per 100 women |
| `people_per_building` | `total_population / building_count` | Population density proxy/housing indicator |
| `dependency_ratio` | `(children + elderly) / working_age_population` | Economic dependency measure |

### Analytical Applications

This dataset enables analysis of:
- **Spatial demographic patterns** across Rwanda's administrative hierarchy
- **Age structure variations** and demographic transition indicators
- **Gender distribution** and potential imbalances
- **Population density** and urbanization patterns
- **Regional development** disparities and planning implications
- **Demographic dividend** potential through youth population analysis

The rich geographic hierarchy allows for multi-level analysis, from national patterns down to local cell-level variations, making it ideal for demonstrating statistical techniques across different scales of analysis.
